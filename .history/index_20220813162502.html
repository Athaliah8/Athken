     Michael Joseph Jackson was born On August 29th, 1958. He was pronounced dead on June 25th, 2009. He was fifty years old and suffered a death of severe cardiac arrest. . . I find it almost like a prophecy that he entitled his last tour "This Is It" which was supposed to begin in July of 2009 . . .only a month after his death. And if you think everybody was over his fame, then let me tell you this: in March of 2009 when he announced his final tour, the tickets sold out within less than half an hour.

When I was little, I always wanted to go to Neverland . . I knew it was just a story, a made up place in "Peter Pan", but still a girl could have dreams right? Well one day surfing the internet and looking up ways to get to Neverland, as i often did, I discovered a man named Michael Joseph Jackson, who had his own special Neverland in his backyard, and decided that one day I would meet him and ask to go to see it. Later on in life I found out exactly how hard this dream would be, and now it is impossible. However, I still keep a picture of Neverland Ranch hanging on my bedroom door...

Although all great singers occasionally have a songwriter come up with a hit, most of Michael's are his own. "Black or White" is my favorite song because number one: he wrote it himself, and number two: the message in it is so strong that you can't help but be moved by the true meaning of his lyrics. Songs like "You Are Not Alone" are messages hidden within the music, and anybody that can make a person cry just by singing a song is definitely a very talented person.

Although my opinion may be far different from that of my peers, I personally believe that Michael Jackson is the best singer whose feet ever touched earth. And nobody, not even his own sister Janet Jackson, can dance the way he did. This man had a true passion and love for music and dance, and I hope one day I can develop that much dedication to the things I care about.

This man is a hero to me for many different reasons, but mostly this: When a false charge almost ruined his career, he never gave up. He kept his head held high and told the world he was the king, and that's exactly what he became.
